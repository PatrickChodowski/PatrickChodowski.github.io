    <h2><a href="/blog/nbar11/">NBAr 1.1 update</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">April 9, 2018</p>
    <div class="content">
    Hola!
Just wanted to let you all know that I recently updated NBAr with couple of new functions:
getAllPlaytypesgetAllTrackinggetHustleBoxscoregetMatchupsInteresting story with getAllPlaytypes and getAlltracking - I just recently started to using player tracking and playtypes data and realized they really need wrapping functions to download and combine all at once. Here they are - quite simple, quite good. Both create datasets with +120 columns but I made sure there are no duplicates or some dissapearing players.

    <h2><a href="/blog/player_dashb/">NBA Player stats dashboard v1.0</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">March 19, 2018</p>
    <div class="content">
    Have you ever had that feeling that you really need another dashboard with NBA player’s data in your life?
Me neither.
Well, actually, I had! So I developed one! You can find it here
All data collected using NBAr package - check it out here!
I use it mostly for analysis I do and I found it is actually useful tool to access player’s data easily - I tried to keep as much information in one place as I could so I don’t have to jump around pages and filters like I need on nba.

    <h2><a href="/blog/outliers_nba/">Detecting outlying statlines in NBA</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">November 28, 2017</p>
    <div class="content">
    We all know what happens on social media after - insert name of random/unknown/boring/funny/weird/forgotten player - all of sudden makes all 8 of his 3 point attempts, scores thousands of points and wins that very important game in mid-January for his team. You know, the monthly-Jeff-Green-can-be-a-factor-in-the-playoffs game.
We have seen the Brandon-Jennings-scoring-55-as-a-rookie game. That Kendrick-Perkins-owns-Nuggets-in-the-paint-with-16pts performance (that, for me as a Nuggets fan, was heartbreaking). All those Dwight-Howard-after-years-of-struggle-is-finally-back games. Jonas Valanciunas pump-fake finally fools a defender.

    <p class="timestamp">July 1, 2017</p>
    <div class="content">
    Lets try to predict what will happen in NBA finals. On one side - uber team with perennial all stars, 2 of top3 NBA players, 3 of top10, 4 of top15. Golden State is a monster. They can shoot from anywhere, contested or not, pull up, spot up, you name it. On defense they switch on screens in the blink of an eye, with every member of their death lineup able to guard almost all positions (Curry will not guard frontcourt guys).

    <h2><a href="/blog/stoptheball/">Stop the ball in transition</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">June 3, 2017</p>
    <div class="content">
    Just seconds before you finished your spectacular dribbling showcase, barely left defender behind your back and tried that wild shot which was perfect, beside the fact that ball bricked the glass and your teammates had no chance to rebound it, since all of them were waiting for a pass on the weakside.
Shooters have short memory, they say.
Now you are running back on defense, turning around and seeing 7 feet of Kevin Durant approaching a bit too fast with the ball.

    <h2><a href="/blog/nbar/">NBAr - scrape NBA data from NBA.com API</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">May 5, 2017</p>
    <div class="content">
    NBArThere was never a better time to be NBA, R and data analysis fan. Might be not the most useful tool nor the most exciting, but NBAr contains set of wrapper functions for downloading and simple processing of data from http://stats.nba.com API.
Over the last year functions contained in NBAr package helped my write my master thesis and also couple of blog posts on this site. Before I finally start writing more frequently I decided to finish the package and upload it on github so everyone can see it, use it, give feedback or contribute.
