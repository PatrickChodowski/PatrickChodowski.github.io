<p>Have you ever had that feeling that you really need another dashboard with NBA player’s data in your life?</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>Well, actually, I had! So I developed one! <a href="https://www.per48.co/shiny/nbar/">You can find it here</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PatrickChodowski/NBAr">All data collected using NBAr package - check it out here!</a></p>
<p>I use it mostly for analysis I do and I found it is actually useful tool to access player’s data easily - I tried to keep as much information in one place as I could so I don’t have to jump around pages and filters like I need on nba.com.</p>
<p>I called it version 1.0 because I plan to build more stuff on it and make some tweaks in the future so I will show even bigger picture. So far it contains:</p>
<div id="left-hand-filter-panel" class="section level3">
<h3>Left hand filter panel:</h3>
<p>In that panel you can select</p>
<ul>
<li>Season (can be multiple, but full data is from 2015)</li>
<li>Player (by default I set Al Horford, since everybody likes him)</li>
<li>Date range (updated on season)</li>
<li>Opponents team in a very nice grid</li>
<li>Drag and drop Stat selection, which is definately a highlight of this panel (also it is not working on mobile)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also switch for per36/per48/perGame data, for daily numbers it is no use. (planning to put monthly and seasonal numbers in close future).</p>
</div>
<div id="players-summary-tab" class="section level3">
<h3>Players Summary tab:</h3>
<p>Show daily data and general distribution for statistics specified on the left hand panel. Bar chart has daily values, rolling mean and cumulated mean.</p>
</div>
<div id="locationopponent-tab" class="section level3">
<h3>Location/Opponent tab:</h3>
<p>Presents boxplots for Home/Away and Opponent splits. Useful to check how players performs in different situations.</p>
</div>
<div id="shots" class="section level3">
<h3>Shots:</h3>
<p>Classic tab contains players shotcharts for values specified in both left side panel and shots panel. Grid has all shots, points distribution, player’s efficiency and leaguess efficiency.</p>
<p>Interactive plot is a big shotchart with interactive area (still looking for proper use case though..)</p>
</div>
<div id="game-logs" class="section level3">
<h3>Game logs:</h3>
<p>That’s just a table with numbers</p>
</div>
<div id="top-players" class="section level3">
<h3>Top players:</h3>
<p>Leagues top players sorted in given category. It’s very fast ranking tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="possible-extensions" class="section level3">
<h3>Possible extensions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding monthly and seasonal data</li>
<li>Adds players bio with photo and team</li>
<li>Team tab (that’s huge one)</li>
<li>Finding a good use for interactive shotchart</li>
<li>Player comparison option</li>
<li>Lineups and matchups data</li>
</ul>
<p>Dashboard still needs proper tests so if you find it useful or interesting please write to me on Twitter or send me an email. I welcome any feedback on it!</p>
