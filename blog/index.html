    <div class="content">
    Christmas came early this year! Woohoo!
Happy to officially announce NBAr 2.0 update
(that is available on github for some time now…)
List of significant changes:
 NBA’s api became really unstable if it’s called without referall, so it the readr::read_lines had to be replaced with httr::GET Old code sometimes looked really bad and I felt bad because of it To keep it consistent, most of the dependencies is on Tidyverse packages functions_and_argument_names_are_finally_in_snake_case !

    <p class="timestamp">February 2, 2019</p>
    <div class="content">
    IntroductionThis blog post is definately not about love, I can assure you that.
I have to admit to myself that after being fanatic R user for more than 3 years, it’s time to learn something new and add cool stuff to my little green toolbox. Anytime I needed to do stuff with data outside of databases I was launching rstudio and was ready to go in no time with well known and comfortable tidy libraries, pipelines and Rprojects.

    <h2><a href="/blog/r-cumulative-unique-count-dplyr/">How to do cumulative unique count with R and dplyr</a></h2>
    <p class="timestamp">August 23, 2018</p>
    <div class="content">
    Couple of days ago I had to find a way to visualize in R cumulative number of unique customers over period of time. Having data with dates and customer ids ready I felt pretty confident that I will finish the task in seconds and most of the time will be eaten by loading tidyverse package. Damn I could have felt the coffee break LOOMING behind my screen.
Little did I know back then but apparently there is no function yet to do just that one task.

    About seriesIntroductionSplinesLinear splineQuadratic splineCubic splineExampleLocal Regression (LOESS)Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)Training GAMsAbout seriesSo I came up with an idea to write series of articles describing how to apply machine learning algorithms on some examples of NBA data. Got to say that plan is quite ambitious - I want to start with machine learning basics, go through some common data problems, required preprocessing tasks and obviously, algorithms.
